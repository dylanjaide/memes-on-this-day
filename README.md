# Memes On This Day

This is an "on this day" database, with a focus on the history of internet memes. Users can enter a day of the year, and are shown an event relevant to a meme.

The site is hosted using GitHub pages. The current live version (branch `main`) can be viewed at [https://dylanjai.de/memes-on-this-day/](https://dylanjai.de/memes-on-this-day/).

## Support

If you found something incorrect or a broken link/image/video, or have any other complaints or suggestions, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/dylanjaide/memes-on-this-day/issues/new).

## Roadmap

The primary features and layout of the site are currently largely complete. The primary thing that needs work on at the moment is filling up the database, with the aim being to have at least one entry for all 366 days of the year.

## Contributing

Contributions are currently being accepted, with a focus on additions to the [database](https://github.com/dylanjaide/memes-on-this-day/blob/main/data.js).
